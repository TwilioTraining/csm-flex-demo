# CSM Flex Workshop - Practice Code

## What is this for?
This repository is for students of the Twilio CSM Flex Workshop. This repository contains Flex specific plugins which you will be able to us to quickly make changes to your Flex Project.

## Instructions
1. [Download]("https://github.com/TwilioTraining/csm-flex-demo/archive/master.zip") this code repository to your computer.
2. Unzip the downloaded code.
3. In the `csm-flex-demo` folder that you just unzipped you will see folders name `plugin-*`, like `plugin-theme` for example.
4. Inside the `plugin-*` folders you will find a `build` folder.
5. Clicking into the `build` folder you will find a file ending in `.js`. This is the file that you can drag and drop into your Twilio Assets. This will then force your Twilio hosted Flex project to change.
